# Average Temp

## Overview:
	* This is a small project made by Nguyen Long Quang while learning the "Machine Learning" course of Andrew Ng.
	* The goal is to predict the average temperature (Fahrenheit) in the month of March in Downtown Los Angeles 5 years from now, given the record of the last 145 years.
	* This project used:
		- Linear Regression model.
		- Gradient descent algorithm (with Feature Scaling).
    - C++ encapsulation (OOPs).
  * This prroject included:
    - Original code library to quickly repair and make changes on future projects.

## Usage:
  * Input address of the training data file (text file).
  * Wait. 
  * Input year needed prediction.
  * Output average temperature in the month of March (Fahrenheit).
